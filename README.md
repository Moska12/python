# OverView of the Project

The backend framework for our project, a library management system, is Flask for Python. we've utilized HTML/CSS for the front-end interface and incorporated SQLAlchemy for database administration. Book administration (adding, listing, and maybe checking in/out), user authentication (login and registration), and book information presentation are important aspects.

To elaborate:
User authentication: In order to give users safe access to the system, we've included login and registration features.

Book management include displaying all of the books that are available, adding new books to the system, and perhaps even putting in place facilities that allow users to check books in and out.

Database management: we have effectively stored and retrieved user and book information by using SQLAlchemy to communicate with the SQLite database.  Front-end Interface: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the library system is created using HTML and CSS. This interface includes forms for registering, logging in, managing books, and displaying book information.

testing Focus: we are also concentrating on improving and troubleshooting the manage books feature's operation to make sure it correctly adds new books to the database and interfaces with the other parts of the system.
